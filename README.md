Android S&P500 Stock Quote Project
==================================

This was my first Android app.  It allows the user to search an SQLite database populated with S&P 500 stock data from 
Yahoo! Finance.  Upon opening the app, the databse is updated and the five best and worst performing stock are displayed 
along with their daily percent change.  From here, the user can search for any stock tracked by the S&P 500 which will
return the stock's daily price and volume information along with the options to view a chart or current news about the 
stock.

This Android application allows the user to search an SQLite database populated with S&P 500 data from Yahoo! Finance.  
Upon opening the app, the database is updated, and when complete, the ticker symbols of the five best and worst 
performing stocks are diplayed along with their daily percent change.  From this screen, the user can enter the ticker
symbol from any stock belonging to the S&P 500 in the search bar.  Upon selecting 'Submit', the stock's key fundamental
data is displayed in a table along with buttons to view the stock's chart or current news.
